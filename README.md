# Monitor Manager
rivy/monitorprofiler fork

Controls :
- brightness / contrast / rgb gain
- sharpness / volume
- change source
- put in standby / power off
- reset factory defaults
- "hidden" hotkey to power on all monitors : winkey + 0 (won't work on windows login screen)

A problem ?
- there's a lot of problems I know, you can try fixing them yourself first cause I'm slow at coding, really slow
- if the app is not working with your monitor send it to me I'll be happy to debug and try to add compatibility (I can't guarantee compatibility will be added, no monitor will be returned, I'll keep everything !!) :)

TODO :
- kill someone at microsoft because wpf styling is a fuckin' pain in the ass
- add hotkeys to change brightness / contrast, + / - maybe some menu for this
- finish profiles save / load etc ..
- handle when profiles (settings) file doesn't exist
- add a white (windows 10) theme, maybe
