Controls monitors :
- brightness / contrast / rgb gain
- sharpness / volume
- change source
- put in standby / power off
- reset factory defaults

- "hidden" hotkey to power on all monitors : winkey + 0 (won't work on windows login screen)

TODO :
- kill someone at microsoft because wpf styling is a fuckin' pain in the ass
- add hotkeys to change brightness / contrast, + / -
maybe some menu for this
- finish profiles save / load etc ..
- handle when profiles (settings) file doesn't exist
- add a white (windows 10) theme, maybe
